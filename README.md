# About

**H**igh-**P**erformance **L**iquid **C**hromatography (HPLC) is an analytical
technique which allows for quantitative characterization of the chemical
components of a mixture. While many of the technical details of HPLC are now
automated, the programmatic cleaning and processing of the resulting data often requires extensive manual labor. This package was
developed to alleviate some of this burden, making the actual running of the
HPLC the most time-consuming part of the quantification. 

# Installation
