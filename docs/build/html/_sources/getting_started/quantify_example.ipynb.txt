    "**H**igh-**P**erformance **L**iquid **C**hromatography (HPLC) is an analytical technique which allows for the quantitative characterization of the chemical components of a mixture. \n",
    "While many of the technical details of HPLC are now automated, the programmatic cleaning and processing of the resulting data can be cumbersome. This package was developed to alevieate some of this burden, making the actual running of the HPLC the most time consuming part of the analysis. \n",
